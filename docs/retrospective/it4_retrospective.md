We were able to continue developing our recommendation algorithm during this iteration in order to consider more of the user preferences, such as distance. We were also able to fully implement the ticketmaster API to gather a greater amount of events to suggest and offer to users who either want to see a whole list of events or get an optimized schedule. We also started to dramatically the UI, but we had to save this implementation for the sake of the time, but will implement it for iteration 5. We were also able to use celery to continue refreshing the database with new events every 12 hours. 

For iteration 5, we are hoping to continue developing the UI to be more aesthetic. We also want to continue making our recommendation algorithm more robust to consider even more factors to give users a better optimized schedule. Additionally, we want to take the time to attempt a better sign in page that can take advantage of Google authentication.
