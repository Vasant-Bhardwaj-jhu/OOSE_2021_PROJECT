For iteration 5, we sucessfully updated the user interface of Eventful in order to be more user-friendly and aesthetic when the user is attempting to create their optimized
schedule or see a list of all possible events that are found in their area. We were able to take advantage of css and stylesheets in order to make this user interface well-suited
for our Beta release. 

We were also able to sort events by category and update the event display time due to previous issues with the timezone calculations and parsing the event start and end time.

Peter, Sabrina, Aryaman, and Vasant worked on the backend of the application. Jose, AB, and Karry worked on the user interface.

When reflecting on our initial project proposal, we stayed consistent with our vision of creating app that is able to use a recommendation algorithm that can offer a user
a personalized and optimized schedule based on their location and preferences. Our vision changed in terms of APIs that we could use due to unexpected changes to the documentation and difficulty
obtaining keys for some databases. Also, we encountered issues with database refreshing services, as there were few options that were feasible and free of use, and we were not able 
to finance an expensive form of database refreshing to load the most up-to-date events for users. If we could go back, we would affirm the type of APIs that we can use and
be more consistent in our approach each week.
